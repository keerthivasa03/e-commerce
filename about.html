                        <span>Developers:</span>
                        Developers are primarily focused on coding and programming. They specialize in writing and structuring the code that powers websites, applications, software, and more. They can be further categorized into:
                        
                        Front-end Developers: They work on the client-side of applications, dealing with the visual aspects that users interact with directly. They use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive, interactive user interfaces.
                        
                        Back-end Developers: They handle the server-side operations, working behind the scenes to ensure that everything functions smoothly. They work with databases, server scripting languages (such as PHP, Python, Ruby, etc.), and frameworks to manage data and server operations.
                        
                        Full-stack Developers: They are skilled in both front-end and back-end development, capable of handling all aspects of web development, from server management to user interface design.
                        
                       <span> Designers:</span>
                        Designers focus on the visual and conceptual aspects of a product, aiming to create engaging and user-friendly experiences. Different types of designers include:
                        
                        Graphic Designers: They specialize in creating visual content such as logos, illustrations, and branding materials. They work with tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and other design software.
                        
                        UI/UX Designers: User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) designers focus on creating intuitive, visually appealing, and user-friendly interfaces. UI designers focus on the look and feel, while UX designers emphasize the overall experience and functionality.
                        
                        Product Designers: They work on the entire product development process, from conceptualization to execution. They consider user needs, market research, and functionality to create comprehensive product designs.</p>
